# OpenAI Integration for AI Chat System

## ü§ñ Overview

The AI Chat System now includes full OpenAI integration for intelligent, context-aware customer service conversations. The system automatically falls back to rule-based responses if OpenAI is unavailable, ensuring reliable operation.

## üöÄ Features

### OpenAI Integration

- **GPT-3.5-turbo** model for natural conversation
- **Function calling** for structured intent classification
- **Context awareness** with conversation history
- **Automatic fallback** to rule-based responses
- **Cost optimization** with token limits and temperature control

### Enhanced AI Capabilities

- **Intent Classification**: Accurately identifies customer needs
- **Entity Extraction**: Extracts car types, services, timing preferences
- **Dynamic System Prompts**: Context-aware responses based on user profile
- **Smart Suggestions**: Contextual next actions
- **Escalation Detection**: Identifies when human assistance is needed

## üîß Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables

Add your OpenAI API key to all environment files:

```env
# OpenAI Configuration for AI Chat System
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
```

### 2. Getting OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Create an account or sign in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new secret key
5. Copy the key and add it to your environment files

### 3. Cost Considerations

Current configuration:

- **Model**: GPT-3.5-turbo (cost-effective)
- **Max Tokens**: 500 per response
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity)

Estimated costs (as of 2024):

- GPT-3.5-turbo: ~$0.002 per 1K tokens
- Average conversation: 10-20 messages
- Estimated cost: $0.01-0.02 per conversation

## üí° How It Works

### 1. Message Processing Flow

```
User Message ‚Üí OpenAI Processing ‚Üí Intent Classification ‚Üí AI Response
                      ‚Üì (if fails)
                 Rule-based Fallback ‚Üí Response
```

### 2. OpenAI Function Calling

The system uses OpenAI's function calling feature to:

- Classify intents accurately
- Extract relevant data
- Generate appropriate suggestions
- Determine escalation needs

### 3. Context Management

Each conversation includes:

- **System Prompt**: Car wash service context
- **User Profile**: Car information, preferences
- **Conversation History**: Previous messages
- **Service Context**: Current module/location

## üéØ Intent Classification

The AI can identify these intents:

| Intent             | Description                 | Example                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `service_inquiry`  | Questions about services    | "I need a car wash"             |
| `price_inquiry`    | Pricing questions           | "How much does it cost?"        |
| `booking_intent`   | Booking requests            | "I want to book an appointment" |
| `location_inquiry` | Location/provider questions | "Find providers near me"        |
| `support_request`  | Issues needing human help   | "I have a problem"              |
| `greeting`         | Initial greetings           | "Hello"                         |
| `general`          | Other questions             | "What do you offer?"            |

## üìù System Prompts

The AI uses dynamic system prompts that include:

### Base Prompt

```
You are a helpful AI assistant for a car wash service platform.
Your role is to help customers find services, get pricing information,
book appointments, and provide support.
```

### Contextual Information

- Platform capabilities and services
- User's registered vehicles
- Current location/module
- Response guidelines

### Response Guidelines

- Be friendly and professional
- Keep responses concise
- Provide 2-4 relevant suggestions
- Ask for missing information
- Escalate complex issues

## üîÑ Fallback Mechanism

If OpenAI fails or is unavailable:

1. **Automatic Detection**: System catches OpenAI errors
2. **Rule-based Processing**: Uses pattern matching
3. **Consistent Response**: Same interface and format
4. **Logging**: Errors logged for monitoring
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Users don't notice the switch

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

### Error Tracking

```typescript
logger.error('OpenAI processing failed, falling back to rules', { error });
logger.warn('OpenAI API key not found, using rule-based responses');
```

### Performance Metrics

- Response time monitoring
- Success/failure rates
- Token usage tracking
- Cost analysis

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Service Inquiry

```
üë§ User: "I need a car wash for my SUV"
ü§ñ AI: "I can help you find the perfect service for your SUV! We offer
       basic wash ($20), premium detailing ($40), and full-service
       packages ($60). What type of service interests you most?"
üí° Suggestions: ["Book basic wash", "Learn about premium", "Compare packages", "Find nearby providers"]
```

### Price Inquiry

```
üë§ User: "How much does premium detailing cost?"
ü§ñ AI: "Premium detailing for SUVs starts at $40 and includes interior
       cleaning, exterior wash, wax, and tire shine. Would you like
       to see providers near you or book this service?"
üí° Suggestions: ["Book premium detailing", "Find providers", "Compare with other packages", "Add car details"]
```

### Booking Intent

```
üë§ User: "I want to book a wash for tomorrow"
ü§ñ AI: "Perfect! I can help you book for tomorrow. I can either auto-select
       the best provider near you or let you choose from available options.
       Which would you prefer?"
üí° Suggestions: ["Auto-select provider", "Choose provider", "Select time slot", "Review services"]
```

## üîß Customization

### Adjusting Model Parameters

In `aiService.ts`, you can modify:

```typescript
const completion = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // Model choice
  max_tokens: 500, // Response length
  temperature: 0.7, // Creativity level
  // ... other parameters
});
```
